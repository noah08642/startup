# Luke Richards Blog!

[My Notes](notes.md)

My application is a personal website!

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

For my startup I am going to make a personal blog.  This will have a clean, retro design, with the ability for users to view blog post titles and click on the one that entices them.  They will also have the ability to subscribe and get sent emails of the future blog posts.

### Design

<img width="540" alt="Subscribe - 1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62f425a0-2727-42fa-bc99-b4db828d53df" />
<img width="540" alt="Subscribe - 2" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e9a640a-f4d8-42a7-991d-fe754aae845c" />



The design will feature a clean, retro theme reminiscent of the early macintosh design.  In the selection menu, there will be rectangles with the titles inside, all lined up chronologically with the most recent post at the top.  At the bottom of the web page, after having scrolled through all of the posts, will be a a subscribe button.  When the user presses it, it queries for the user's email and displays a positive message once subscribed.

```

### Key features

- Select a blog post
- Blog page
- Subscribe button
- Little sparkle happens on the main site when someone subscribes

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Structure the content of the web application, including blog post titles, articles, and interactive elements such as the subscribe button.
- **CSS** - Style the application with a clean, retro design, incorporating animations for visual feedback like sparkles and responsive layouts for different devices.
- **React** - Create a dynamic, component-based front-end to manage blog post rendering, user interactions, and real-time UI updates.
- **Service** - Handle backend logic, including API endpoints for fetching and managing blog posts, handling subscriptions, and sending email notifications.
- **DB/Login** - Store blog post data and manage user subscriptions securely. Authentication features could be added later if user login becomes necessary.
- **WebSocket** - Enable real-time communication for features like live post updates or displaying recent subscriber actions with minimal latency.
